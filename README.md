# CINEMATCH

WHAT IS CINEMATCH 
- Cinematch is a Python Based Movie recommendation generator designed to help users quickly find movies based on their preferred streaming service and genre. It features a simple graphical user interfae built using Tkinter, allowing users to select options from dropdown menus and instantly receive movie suggestions.

HOW DOES CINEMATCH CODE WORK? 
- To run the code I would utilise Visual Studio Code.
- Next a small Tkinter window would open up and you can choose what streaming service your using like Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon, and then pick a genre like action or comedy. Once you hit the button it randomly picks a movie from that category and shows it on the screen.
- After a movie is suggested, you can click on one to five stars. When you rate a movie the program then stores that information in a dictionary, so if the same movie gets recommended again, Cinematch can show your previous rating next to it.
